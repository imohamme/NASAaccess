About
*****

The **NASAaccess** platform is available as software packages (i.e., R and conda packages) as well as an interactive format web-based environmental modeling application for earth observation data developed in the Tethys Platform framework (https://www.tethysplatform.org/). **NASAaccess** software can generate gridded ascii tables of climate `CMIP5 <https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/>`_, `CMIP6 <https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/>`_, and earth observation remote sensing data (`GPM <https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/directory>`_, `TRMM <https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/trmm>`_, `GLDAS <https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas>`_) needed to drive various hydrological models (e.g., `VIC <https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC>`_, `RHESSys <https://github.com/RHESSys/RHESSys>`_, `SWAT <https://swat.tamu.edu/>`_ â€¦etc.).  The **NASAaccess** has been envisioned to lower the technical barrier and simplify the process of accessing scalable distributed computing resources and leverage additional software for data and computationally intensive modeling frameworks. **NASAaccess** Tethys web-based application can be used for accessing, reformatting, and visualizing climate and earth observation remote sensing gridded time series data as well.

How it works
************

The **NASAaccess** Tethys Application is simply a user interface for passing arguments into the **NASAaccess**
functions by calling the `r-nasaaccess` conda package (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-nasaaccess). Using a combination of dropdowns, datepickers, and checkboxes, the app allows the user to select a watershed boundary, DEM, date range, and NASAaccess function(s) to pass to the server for running the selected **NASAaccess** function(s).


Requirements
************

- Windows:
            Setup a VirtualBox Machine via https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads   

- Windows/MacOS/Linux:
            Anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)  or miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)


Installation/Setup
******************
- EarthData:
      **NASAaccess** needs a user registration access with Earthdata (https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/). Users should set up a registration account(s) with Earthdata login as well as authorizing NASA GES DISC data access. Please refer to https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access for further details.

            -   After registration with .. _Earthdata: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/ *NASAaccess* software package users should create a reference file (*netrc*) with .. _Earthdata: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/ credentials stored in it to streamline the retrieval access to .. _NASA https://www.nasa.gov/ servers.

            -   Creating the *.netrc* file at the user machine *Home* directory and storing the user .. _NASA https://www.nasa.gov/  .. _GES DISC https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ logging information in it is needed to execute the *NASAaccess* package commands. Accessing data at NASA servers is further explained at https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Access+Data+With+cURL+And+Wget.

- Tethys:
      The **NASAaccess** Tethys Application requires the Tethys Platform to be installed beforehand. The Tethys Platform Framework installation process can be installed in a development and production environment. There is a couple of differences between both installations:

         - The production installation uses a combination of the NGINX and Daphne servers.
         - Changes Are Not Automatically Loaded in the production server, but in the development server
         - Debug Disabled to prevent sensitive information from being leaked in the production server
         - Static Files Collected  are collected to one location to be served more efficiently by NGINX.
         - Workspaces are collected to one location so they can be more easily backed up.
         - NGINX is given permission to access the static files and workspaces to be able to serve them.


   - Development:   
      The installation of tethys in a development environment serves to contribute to the development of new applications and of the Tethys platform itself. The following are the required steps:

                                       1. Create  a new conda environment and install the Tethys Platform by running the following command:
                                       ::

                                          conda create -n tethys -c tethysplatform -c conda-forge tethys-platform

                                       2. Activate the Tethys conda Environment:
                                       ::

                                          conda activate tethys
                                       
                                       3. Generate a portal_config.yml file containing custom configurations such as the database and other local settings by running the following command:
                                       ::

                                          tethys gen portal_config
                                       
                                       4. Tethys Platform requires a PostgreSQL database server. There are several options for setting up a DB server: local, docker, or dedicated. The Tethys platform can also be used to create a local server that creates and migrates the tables associated with the Tethys platform framework by running:

                                             a. Local instance
                                             ::

                                                tethys db configure
                                             
                                             b. Docker local instance (requires docker installed beforehand)
                                             ::

                                                tethys docker init -c postgis

                                                tethys docker start -c postgis

                                                PGPASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> tethys db configure --username <TETHYS_DB_USERNAME> --password <TETHYS_DB_PASSWORD> --superuser-name <TETHYS_DB_SUPER_USERNAME> --superuser-password <TETHYS_DB_SUPER_PASSWORD> --portal-superuser-name <PORTAL_SUPERUSER_USERNAME> --portal-superuser-email '<PORTAL_SUPERUSER_EMAIL>' --portal-superuser-pass <PORTAL_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD>

                                       5. Install `r-nasaaccess` in the tethsy environment:
                                       ::

                                          conda install -c conda-forge r-nasaaccess

                                       6. Initialize tables in persistent store databases:
                                       ::

                                          tethys syncstores nasaaccess

                                       7. Finally start the Tethys development server:
                                       ::

                                          tethys manage start

   - Production:
      Installation in a production environment can be a manual installation (performing all of the production configuration steps manually) or a docker deployment.  The following steps assumed the installation of Tethys in an Ubuntu production server (Note that before installing the Tethys platform, the following requirements needs to be installed).

      - Requirements:

            + PostgreSQL
            + NGINX
            + Supervisor

         - File Configuration:

                  + Configuration Static and Workspace:

                     + Static files
                        ::


                           sudo mkdir -p <TETHYS_WORKSPACES_ROOT>
                           sudo chown -R $USER <TETHYS_WORKSPACES_ROOT>
                           tethys settings --set STATIC_ROOT /my/custom/static/directory
                           tethys manage collectstatic


                     + Workspaces
                        ::


                           sudo mkdir -p <TETHYS_WORKSPACES_ROOT>
                           sudo chown -R $USER <TETHYS_WORKSPACES_ROOT>

                           tethys manage collectworkspaces


         - NGINX Configuration:

                  + Generate the NGINX configuration file using the tethys gen command
                     ::


                        tethys gen nginx --overwrite


                  + Link the Tethys NGINX Configuration
                     ::


                        sudo ln -s <TETHYS_HOME>/tethys_nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/tethys_nginx.conf


                  + Remove the Default NGINX Configuration
                     ::


                        sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default	

                  + Get the name of the nginx user for use
                     ::


                        grep 'user .*;' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F';' '{print $1}'


         - Supervisor Configuration:

                  + Use the tethys gen command to generate default versions of these configuration files
                     ::


                        tethys gen nginx_service --overwrite
                        tethys gen asgi_service --overwrite


                  + If the process file is specified to be created at the root /run directory (e.g /run/tethys_asgi%(process_num)d.sock), then no action is required for this step.


                  + Link the Tethys Supervisor Configuration Files
                     ::


                        sudo ln -s <TETHYS_HOME>/asgi_supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/asgi_supervisord.conf
                        sudo ln -s <TETHYS_HOME>/nginx_supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/nginx_supervisord.conf


                  + Setup Tethys Log
                     ::


                        sudo mkdir -p /var/log/tethys
                        sudo touch /var/log/tethys/tethys.log
                        sudo chown -R <NGINX_USER> /var/log/tethys


                  + Reload the Configuration
                     ::


                        sudo supervisorctl reread
                        sudo supervisorctl update



         The steps for a manual and docker installation can be found in the Tethys platform documentation (http://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/stable/).



- GeoServer:

      Installation of GeoServer is necessary in order to use the **NASAaccess** Tethys web-based application. The GeosServer Software can be downloaded and installed on your local machine from (https://geoserver.org) or using the Tethys platform, which allows users to pull and run a GeoServer container. The following commands can be used to install GeoServer through the Tethys Platform, when prompted for settings value, press enter to keep the default values:
      ::


         tethys docker init -c geoserver
         tethys docker start -c geoserver


      If GeoServer was installed from source, start GeoServer by changing into the directory ``geoserver/bin`` and executing the `startup.sh` script with the following commands:
      ::


         cd geoserver/bin
         sh startup.sh


      Then, in a web browser, navigate to (http://localhost:8080/geoserver) to ensure that the GeoServer was installed successfully. Then, create a workspace with any name and upload a shapefile and associated digital elevation model (DEM) for your study area to your designated workspace. In the following screenshot we created a workspace named `nasaaccess` to illustrate publishing data to GeoServer. The details of the published data in GeoServer will be needed later in setting up the custom settings of the NASAaccess application.
      The screenshots shown below give the details needed in creating GeoServer workspace named `nasaaccess` and uploaded layers needed (i.e., shapefile and a digital elevation model - DEM) for the **NASAaccess** web-based application.

         :align: center

         GeoServer with published shapefile (i.e., basin) and a digital elevation model (i.e., Bayou-dem) stored in `nasaaccess` workspace.

















- **NASAaccess** Application Installation:

      After successful installation of the Tethys Platform and the GeoServer software on your work environment, clone the repository of the **NASAaccess** application available in Github. Next, install the application into the Tethys platform. Once the installation has started, the user will be prompted to select a spatial persistent service and the custom settings related to the application. Finally, start the Tethys development server after the installation has finished. The following commands and steps summarize the process of NASAaccess application installation:

      ::

         conda activate tethys

         git clone https://github.com/imohamme/tethys_nasaaccess.git

         cd tethys_nasaaccess


      
      .. note::
      
               make sure the libraries listed in requirements.txt are installed in your tethys environment (i.e., `r-nasaaccess`, `r-remotes`, `r-emayili`, and `r-codetools`)




      ::

         tethys install -d




      + Select the GeoSpatial persistent service (In this case, the installed GeoServer).

      + Enter the value for the custom settings of the NASAaccess application:

            + *data path*: custom setting referring to the path of the data directory for download. 

            + *nasaaccess_R*: custom setting referring to the *Rbin* path.

            + *nasaacess_script*: custom setting referring to the nasaaccess R script containing the logic for data download using the r-nasaaccess conda package.

            + *geoserver workspace*: custom setting referring to the GeoServer workspace name associated with the NASAacces application.

            + *geoserver URI*: custom setting referring to the GeoServer workspace URI associated with the NASAacces application.

            + *geoserver user*: custom setting referring to the GeoServer admin user.

            + *geoserver password*: custom setting referring to the password related to the user of the geoserver user setting.

      + Then, starting tethys:

         ::
         
            tethys manage start



      It is important to mention here that the custom settings of the **NASAaccess** application can be fixed after installing the application by passing the custom settings step with empty values. After running the Tethys application and navigating to the **NASAaccess** web-based application then these custom settings can be fixed. The following screenshot depicts the custom settings filled with needed information as discussed.






   .. figure:: images/nasaaccess_custom_settings.png
      :align: center

      **NASAaccess** custom settings configuration.



      
      For the installation example shown the following customs settings are used: *data_path* (/pathto/tethys_nasaaccess/nasaaccess_data/), *nasaaccess_R* (/pathto/miniconda3/envs/tethys/bin/Rscript), *nasaaccess_script* (/pathto/tethys_nasaaccess/tethysapp/nasaaccess/scripts/nasaaccess.R), *geoserver_workspace* (nasaaccess), *geoserver_URI* (nasaaccess), *geoserver_user* (admin), and *geoserver_password* (geoserver).





      After fixing the custom settings of the **NASAacces** web-based application, the Spatial dataset service needs to be configured manually as shown below. Note here the spatial dataset name is listed as `asaaccess` which is the GeoServer workspace configured previously. The username and password credentials need to match the GeoServer workspace configuration. In this case, the username is `admin` and password is `geoserver`.

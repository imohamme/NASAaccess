_NASAaccess_ package has multiple functions such as `GPMpolyCentroid` and `GPMswat` that download, extract, and reformat rainfall remote sensing data of [TRMM](https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/trmm) and [IMERG](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) from [NASA servers](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/directory) for grids within a specified watershed shapefile.

Let's explore `GPMpolyCentroid` and `GPMswat` functions.
## Basic use

Let's look at an example watershed that we want to examine near Houston, TX:
```{r}
library(ggmap)
library(raster)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
#Reading input data
dem_path <- system.file('extdata', 'DEM_TX.tif', package = 'NASAaccess')
shape_path <- system.file("extdata", "basin.shp", package = "NASAaccess")


dem <- raster(dem_path)
shape <- st_read(shape_path)


#plot the watershed data
myMap <- get_stamenmap(bbox = c(left = -96,
                                bottom = 29.7,
                                right = -95.2,
                                top = 30),
                                            maptype = "terrain", 
                                            crop = TRUE,
                                             zoom = 10)


ggmap(myMap) + 
  geom_sf(data = shape, 
          fill = NA, 
          colour = 'red', 
          inherit.aes = FALSE) 

```


The geographic layout of the White Oak Bayou watershed example used in this demonstration is depicted above. Whiteoak Bayou is a tributary for the Buffalo Bayou River (Harris County, Texas). In order to use _NASAaccess_ we also need a digital elevation model (DEM) raster layer. Let's see the White Oak Bayou watershed DEM and a more closer look at the study watershed example.


```{r}
# create a plot of our DEM raster along with watershed
image(dem, main="White Oak Bayou Watershed with Digital Elevation Model (DEM)", 
      col=rev(bpy.colors()), 
      xlab='lon', 
      ylab='lat')

plot(shape$geometry,add=TRUE)

```


Now, let's examine `GPMswat`:

```{r}
#
library(NASAaccess)
GPMswat(Dir = "./GPMswat/",
                  watershed = shape_path,
                  DEM = dem_path,
                  start = "2020-08-1",
                  end = "2020-08-3"
                                    )
#examine the rainfall station file

GPMswat.table<-read.csv('./GPMswat/precipitationMaster.txt')

head(GPMswat.table)

dim(GPMswat.table)
```

`GPMswat` generated ascii table for each available grid located within the study watershed. There are 11 grids within the study watershed and that means 11 tables have been generated. `GPMswat` also generated the rainfall stations file input shown above *GPMswat.table* (table with columns: ID, File NAME, LAT, LONG, and ELEVATION) for those selected grids that fall within the specified watershed.


Now, let's see the location of these generated grid points:

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = shape, 
          fill = NA, 
          colour = 'red') +
  geom_point(data=GPMswat.table,aes(x=LONG,y=LAT,fill=ELEVATION), shape=21, size = 4) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = terrain.colors(7))

```


We note here that `GPMswat` has given us all the [GPM](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) data grids that fall within the boundaries of the White Oak Bayou study watershed.

The time series rainfall data stored in the data tables (i.e., 11 tables) can be viewed also.

```{r}
#looking at reformatted data from the first grid point as listed in the rainfall station file
read.csv('./GPMswat/precipitation2160842.txt')


```

The `GPMswat` has generated a ready format ascii tables that can be ingested easily to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool [SWAT](https://swat.tamu.edu/) model or any other hydrological model of choice.



Now, let's examine `GPMpolyCentroid`.



```{r}

#single shape example
GPMpolyCentroid(Dir = "./GPMpolyCentroid/",
                  watershed = shape_path,
                  DEM = dem_path,
                  start = "2019-08-1",
                  end = "2019-08-3")

#examine the rainfall station file

GPMpolyCentroid.1.table<-read.csv('./GPMpolyCentroid/precipitationMaster.txt')

#plot
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = shape, 
          fill = NA, 
          colour = 'red') +
  geom_point(data=GPMpolyCentroid.1.table,aes(x=LONG,y=LAT))
```


We note here that `GPMpolyCentroid` has given us the [GPM](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) data grid that falls within a specified watershed and assigns a pseudo rainfall gauge located at the centroid of the watershed a weighted-average daily rainfall data.

Description: This package generates gridded ascii tables and station files needed by SWAT or any other hydrological model weather inputs. The package assumes that users have already set up a registration account(s) with Earthdata login as well as authorizing NASA GESDISC data access. Please refer to  https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access for further details. The package relies on 'curl' (https://curl.haxx.se/) commands and library to access NASA remote sensing servers.  Users should make sure that their local machines have 'curl' installed properly.  Instructions on creating the ".netrc" and ".urs_cookies" files can be accessed at https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Access+Data+With+cURL+And+Wget. Creating the ".netrc" file at the user machine 'Home' directory and storing the NASA GESDISC user logging information in it is needed to execute the package commands.
